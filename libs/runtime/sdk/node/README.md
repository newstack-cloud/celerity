# Celerity Runtime SDK for Node.js

This is the Celerity Runtime SDK for Node.js. It provides a set of APIs to launch
and interact with a Celerity Runtime application.

This is a low-level library that in most cases does not need to be used directly. Instead,
you should use the higher-level SDKs such as `@celerity-sdk/handlers`.
